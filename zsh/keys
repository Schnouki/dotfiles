# Many keys for xterm, screen, rxvt, ...
# Before I used $TERM to decide what was needed. But it's much easier that way.

# Tip for (u)rxvt users: if $TERM is set to rxvt-unicode or something like this,
# you will need many stupid keys for arrows, home, end, delete, backspace, etc.
# Just set it to xterm to solve everything. The easiest way to do this is to add
# something similar to "URxvt.termName: xterm" in your ~/.Xdefaults.
